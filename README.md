SMS Sending Service Using Twilio
Integrate SMS sending functionality into your Spring Boot application using the Twilio API.
Here's a step-by-step guide to creating an SMS sending service in Spring Boot using Twilio:

1.Sign Up for Twilio: Create an account with Twilio if you haven't already. You'll need to get your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.

2.Create a Spring Boot Project:

Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or the Spring Initializer.

3.Add Dependencies: In your pom.xml (Maven), add the Twilio Java library as a dependency.

<dependency> <groupId>com.twilio.sdk</groupId> <artifactId>twilio</artifactId> <version>{latest_version}</version> </dependency>

4.Configure Twilio:

Set up your Twilio configuration in your application.properties file. Include your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number.

.  twilio.account.sid=your_account_sid
.  twilio.auth.token=your_auth_token
.  twilio.phone.number=your_twilio_phone_number
5.Create a Service for Sending SMS:

Create a Spring service class (SmsService.java) that interacts with the Twilio API to send SMS messages. You can use the Message.creator class provided by the Twilio library to send SMS messages.

6.Use the SMSService in Your Application:

Inject the SmsService into your controllers (SmsController.java) and use it to send SMS messages as needed.

7.Testing and Logging: Test the SMS sending functionality(you can send sms using postman) and implement proper logging and error handling to ensure that messages are sent successfully and to track any issues.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate SMS sending functionality into your Spring Boot application using the Twilio API.
